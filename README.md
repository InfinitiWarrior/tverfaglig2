This is a school project about scamming
there is an interactive transcript highlighter on the podcast site
i didnt make the video follow when you scroll, because it is a podcast, it is not that important to see the people
there are 2 articles which you can toggle between in the nav bar
there is a home page that send you to the different sites
there is a dropdown menu with dark mode and bigger/smaller text which you can keep clicking to adjust it to your prefrance
and there is a server side proxy that i made using express.js
this can be locally hosted throug node in terminal
