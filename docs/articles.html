            <h1>Online Gaming Relations</h1>
            <p>Social media and gaming are a very good place to communicate, but is it all sun and lollipops or not. In this 5-paragraph text I will go closer and further into different areas. First, I will write about some of the positive outcomes of gaming relationships and how you can meet people and create a connection online. What challenges and dangers should you as parents be aware or warn your kids about. Last of all how you should go through with talking to your children about being online. Hopefully you learn something or get a new perspective on gaming relations through this small text of mine.
              <br><br>
              What are the positive outcomes of having some gaming relationships. I personally believe it’s great to meet new people and this is very easy when you are playing the same game as someone. You can both be just randomly on the same team, and suddenly you have a full-on conversation on how Barack Obama is worse than Donald trump, for example. Very easy to connect with new people, learn about lifestyles and cultures as the time goes on. I´ve met many different types of people on the internet and especially on games, you can of course meet racists, sexists, homophobes, but most of the time, they are also very nice people. My brother used to play a lot of a game called overwatch and he ended up meeting up with the people he played with in real life, and one of them is still a friend to this day. Not to mention how social gaming is, even if you don’t play with new people or if you do, you can always talk with people meet new folk. When I go home after school I often sit down at my pc and I can always find someone to talk to or play with, a lot of them I know from school or real life but some of them is just someone I met online.
               <br><br>
              If you are an adult or parent, make sure you know about the dangers your kids can meet online. One of the most common threats that everybody knows about is child predators and catfishes. Elderly men or adult will go into some sort of group chat or some sort of texting websites like, discord, Ome.tv, snapchat or games. I have met people on the game before that will act like they are a girl or boy just to get attention from people so they will buy them certain things or get sent inappropriate pictures. This is something that is way to common, the number of dark jokes, videos and pictures that are just swerving around the internet is insane, very hard to just be around and not get sent something that will throw you off. Back to what I was saying about predators, make sure that your kid maybe talks to you about who he/she is friends with online and what some boundaries are.
              <br><br>
              How can you talk to your children about boundaries and how to act online. I remember when I was younger, I hated talking to my parents about what and how I was doing online. What I was gaming, who I was gaming with, what did I do on the game today, it felt fake all of it. I never felt like that understood why I liked playing and that it wasn’t so bad for me. I mean I guess it wasn’t like optimal to be gaming 8-14hours a day, but I learnt a lot of English and met a lot of new people. The reason I didn’t want to talk to them about it was because they didn’t know how it worked and what it felt like or what I did, they never watched me play. If you want to know what and who your kid is playing with and how he is acting you should play with him or ask if he can teach you, but you must be present. It might seem like it’s a waste of time, but it will mean a lot to him. The way my parents ended up doing it was that they started making contracts with me for the games I was buying, “Don’t let this game take control on how you act, don’t let it go out on your relationships in real life”. Ask your kid what games he wants and why and so on, those are some open questions that will get him/her talking.
               <br><br>
              To sum up this topic / conclusion I would like to say that it’s a lot of benefits with gaming probably more than negatives but playing 10+ hours a day is a little too much. Don’t let the game take over you’re in real life, add gaming to your life don’t add life to your gaming addiction. Try to take the best out of gaming and the best out of real life and combine them. Be open with your parents and tell them about why you are so much online, maybe they will understand more. Parents you need to act engaged into the conversation or whatever you guys end up doing. Take care of your kids online, but don’t remove the fun from it.</p>

            <h1>Phishing scams</h1>
            <p>There are many scams, and many are famously known, but people still fall for them. Why do people do this? Is it greed? Is it the stress/pressure to claim a reward that will be unavailable soon? Or maybe trusting the people on the web a bit too much. Online scams have more than doubled since the year 2020 and that means there are more ways to scam and newer ways to avoid them. Too many people fall for these scams and lose so much money which means that it is not talked enough about how these scams happen therefore the averseness needs to increase.
              <br><br>
              A few well-known scams are phishing scams, Nigerian prince scams and the fake lottery scam here are how they happen. Phishing is a social engineering scam, where they use trusted websites as their scam by completely copying the whole website and adding a payment somewhere. A different phishing scam is by sending links and files that seem to be legit but may steal your social media and may even start posting about how you got money from listening to it, spreading false facts and rumors. 
              The way the Nigerian prince scam will happen is that you get an email informing you that a Nigerian prince has a frozen bank account.  He needs money to unfreeze it, if you help him, he promises that you will receive some ancient riches, but you won’t. You will instead lose the amount of money you paid. The fake lottery scam is almost the same, you pay to receive a bigger amount of money that “you are eligible to claim,” because you won a lottery you did not sign up for. You will lose the money you paid and maybe some trust in people.
              <br><br>
              Phishing has a lot of consequences, but what they are and how do they happen? Stealing a password can happen when you fall for a phishing scam by downloading any file, except for a .txt file. Links cannot always directly steal your passwords, but they may send you to a fake Facebook or a news page where you must log in. For the average person with 1 password used on most accounts/profiles this may be a big risk to losing sone sensitive information that may lead to a dox. You may lose sensitive information and money when losing a password, because maybe you use the same password on ROBLOX and the bank and they steal all your money. The reason to why phishing is a type of social engineering and cybersecurity attack is because you make/engineer something out of your trust in societies most trustable sites, or apps or even people by using deepfakes and AI. 
              <br><br>
              
              Some general tips would be that can help people from getting scammed are by; preventing phishing by knowing what a phishing scam looks like. You also need to avoid clicking links they may steal stuff from your proxy like IP, which could lead to a DDOS ransom. Never give away information to an unsecure site. Ignore pop-ups when on your browser they are often fake. Avoid opening suspicious documents in an isolated environment. All “Your device has a virus/is infected” pop ups are fake if its pops up in only 1 tab. Memorize/Save important links like bank and that stuff, this may help identifying a scam early before it happens. Clear your cookies and info capsules often they contain info which may lead an algorithm to send you scams related to what you need. Don’t pirate stuff, pay for it instead, because then you won’t be getting a spyware trojan on your pc or phone. Manually go to the site don’t trust any mail or SMS from “your bank.”
              <br><br>
              
              
              Phishing is a dangerous scam that plays with people’s trust using social engineering. By falling for a phishing scam, you may lose money, or even your identity. Since it is so dangerous, we always have cautious when being online. These scams may happen to anyone anytime and it’s difficult to know before it is too late. A lot of people fall for phishing scams even though they know what it looks like, be better by not falling for them by not trusting anyone online, criticize everything, use your critical thinking and fact checking skills and ask hard question. Use 2FA and stay safer in case you do fall for one.
